# NCATS Translator Data Ingests

This software repository forms an integral part of the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium, Performance Phase 3 efforts at biomedical knowledge integration, within the auspices of the **D**ata **ING**est and **O**perations ("DINGO") Working Group.
The repository aggregates and coordinates the development of knowledge-specific and shared library software used for Translator data ingests from primary (mostly external "third party") knowledge sources, into so-called Translator "Tier 1" knowledge graph(s). This software is primarily coded in Python.

A general discussion of the Translator Data Ingest architecture is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11RaXtVAPX_i6MpD1XG2zQMwi81UxEXJuL5cu6FpcyHU).

## Prerequisites

The project uses the [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python package and project manager You will need to [install **uv** onto your system](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), along with a suitable Python (Release 3.12) interpreter.

The project initially (mid-June 2025) uses a conventional unix-style **make** file to execute tasks. For this reason, working within a command line interface terminal.  A MacOSX, Ubuntu or Windows WSL2 (with Ubuntu) is recommended. See the [Developers' README](DEVELOPERS_README.md) for tips on configuring your development environment.

## Initial Minimal Viable Product: CTD

Here, we apply a [koza](https://koza.monarchinitiative.org/) transform of data from the [Comparative Toxicology Database](https://ctdbase.org/), writing the knowledge graph output out to jsonlines (jsonl) files. The project is built and executed using a conventional (unix-like) Makefile:

    │ Usage:
    │     make <target>
    │
    │ Targets:
    │     help                Print this help message
    │ 
    │     all                 Install everything and test
    │     fresh               Clean and install everything
    │     clean               Clean up build artifacts
    │     clobber             Clean up generated files
    │
    │     install             install python requirements
    │     download            Download data
    │     run                 Run the transform
    │
    │     test                Run all tests
    │
    │     lint                Lint all code
    │     format              Format all code  running the following steps.

The task involves the following steps/components:

- Download source data: [download.yaml](./download.yaml)
- CTD transform configuration file: [ctd.yaml](./src/translator_ingest/ingests/ctd/ctd.yaml)
- CTD transform code: [ctd.py](./src/translator_ingest/ingests/ctd/ctd.py)
- [CTD transform documentation](./src/translator_ingest/ingests/ctd/README.md)
- Unit tests: [test_ctd.py](./tests/unit/ctd/test_ctd.py)
