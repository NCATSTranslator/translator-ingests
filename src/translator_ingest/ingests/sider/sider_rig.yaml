      SIDER contains information on marketed drugs and their recorded adverse drug reactions.
      The information is extracted from public documents and package inserts. The current version
      of the database contains data on 1,430 drugs and 5,868 adverse drug reactions.

        rationale: >-
          from http://sideeffects.embl.de/media/download/README:
          There is at least one PT for every LLT, but sometimes the PT is the same as the LLT. LLTs are sometimes too detailed, 
          and therefore you might want to filter for PT."
