  description: >-
    SIDER contains information on marketed drugs and their recorded adverse drug reactions.
    The information is extracted from public documents and package inserts. The current version
    of the database contains data on 1,430 drugs and 5,868 adverse drug reactions.

      filtered_records: include only MedDRA_concept_type = PT (preferred term)
      rationale: >-
        from http://sideeffects.embl.de/media/download/README:
        There is at least one PT for every LLT, but sometimes the PT is the same as the LLT. LLTs are sometimes too detailed, 
        and therefore you might want to filter for PT."

      ui_explanation: "SIDER data report side effect information that is extracted from product labels, regulatory documents, and official package inserts - by an automated NLP-based pipeline tuned to parse text, recognize side-effect relationships between drug and condition concepts, and map them to vocabularies such as MedDRA. The SIDER record used here reports that [OBJECT] can have the side effect [SUBJECT]. This is represented in Translator using the [has_side_efect] relationship."
