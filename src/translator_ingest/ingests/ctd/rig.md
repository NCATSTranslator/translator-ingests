### Description
CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides knowledge, manually curated from the literature, about chemicals and their relationship to other biological entities: chemical to gene/protein interactions plus chemical to disease and gene to disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional and pathway data to aid in the development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying environmentally influenced diseases. It also generates novel inferences by further analyzing the knowledge they curate/create - based on statistically significant connections with intermediate concept (e.g. Chemical X associated with Disease Y based on shared associations with a common set of genes).

## Ingest Information
    
### Utility
CTD is a rich source of manually curated chemical associations to other biological entities which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including treatment predictions, chemical-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries.  It is one of the few sources that focus on non-drug chemicals, e.g. environmental stressors, and how these are related to diseases, biological processes, and genes. 

### Scope
This initial ingest of CTD covers curated Chemical to Disease associations that report therapeutic and marker/mechanism relationships, or statistical associations generated by CTD. Additional types of Chemical associations will be added later. 

### Relevant Files
Source files with content we aim to ingest.

  | File | Location | Description |
  |----------|----------|----------|
  | CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz  | http://ctdbase.org/downloads/ |  Manually curated and computationally inferred associations between chemicals and diseases | 
  | CTD_exposure_events.tsv.gz  | http://ctdbase.org/downloads/ |  Descriptions of statistical studies of how exposure to chemicals affects a particular population, with some records providing outcomes| 
  
### Included Content
Records from relevant files that are included in this ingest.

  | File | Included Records | Fields Used | 
  |----------|----------|----------|
  | CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz  | Curated therapeutic and marker/mechanism associations (rows where a "DirectEvidence" value is populated with type "T" or "M"), as well as inferred associtions (rows lacking a value in the DirectEvidence column)  | ChemicalName, ChemicalID, CasRN, DiseaseName, DiseaseID, DirectEvidence, InferenceGeneSymbol, InferenceScore, OmimIDs, PubMedIDs |

### Filtered Content
Records from relevant files that are not included in the ingest.

  | File | Filtered Records | Rationale |
  |----------|----------|----------|
  | CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz  | None | Currently taking all records with no publication count or inference score cutoffs - but these may be added in future iterations |


### Future Content Considerations (o)

- **Edges**
   - While the current ingest includes only Chemical-Disease Asociations, future iterations will include additional types of associations between Chemicals and GO Terms, Molecular Phenotypes, Genes, etc. See the Ingest Survey table here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R9z-vywupNrD_3ywuOt_sntcTrNlGmhiUWDXUdkPVpM/edit?gid=0#gid=0 for more details.
  - Also consider ingesting additional chemical-disease edges reporting statistical correlations from environmental exposure studies from CTD_exposure_events.tsv.gz. This is a unique/novel source for this kind of knowledge, but there is not a lot of data here, and utility is not yet clear.
  - Consider adding publication count or inference score cutoffs to filter lower quality / confidence records.

- **Node Properties**
  - n/a
    
- **Edge Properties/EPC Metadata**
  - n/a

### Edge Types

|  Subject Category |  Predicate | Object Category | Qualifier Types |  AT / KL  | Edge Properties | UI Explanation |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| ChemicalEntity | treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat | DiseaseOrPhenotypic Feature  |  n/a  |  manual_agent, knowledge_assertion  |   |  CTD Chemical-Disease records with a "T" (therapeutic) DirectEvidence code indicate the chemical to be a "potential" treatment in virtue of its clinical use or study - which maps best to the Biolink predicate 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat'. |
| ChemicalEntity | 'correlates_with_or_contributes_to' | DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature  |  n/a  |  manual_agent, knowledge_assertion  |   |  CTD Chemical-Disease records with an "M" (marker/mechanism) DirectEvidence code indicate the chemical to correlate with or play an etiological role in a condition - which maps best to the Biolink predicate 'correlates_with_or_contributes_to'. |
| ChemicalEntity | 'associated_with' | DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature  |  n/a  |  data_analysis_pipeline, statisitcal_association  | has_confidence_score |  CTD Chemical-Disease records with an inference score indicate a statistically significant number of shared gene associations that suggest a biological relationship may exist. The statistical basis of this relationship maps to the Biolink 'assocaited_with' predicate. |

**Additional Notes/Rationale (o)**:
- For source records that include an inference score but no 'T' or 'M' flag one edge will be created ('associated_with')
- For source records that include either a 'T' or an 'M' flag nd no inference score, one edge will be created ('treats_or_studied_or_applied_to_treat' or 'correlates_with_or_contributes_to')
- For source records that include an inference score and either a 'T' or an 'M' flag, two edges will be created ('treats_or_studied_or_applied_to_treat' or 'correlates_with_or_contributes_to', and 'associated_with')
- For source records that include an inference core and both 'T' and 'M' flags, three edges will be created ('treats_or_studied_or_applied_to_treat', 'correlates_with_or_contributes_to', and 'associated_with')
- The 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat' predicate is used to avoid making too strong a claim, as CTDs definition of its "T" flag is broad ("a chemical that has a known or potential therapeutic role in a disease"), which covered cases where a chemical may formally treat a disease or only have been studied or applied to treat a disease. All edges are manual agent knowledge assertions, as the ingested data is based on manual literature curation.
- The 'correlates_with_or_contributes_to' predicate is used because the CTD 'M' flag does not distinguish between when a chemical is a correlated marker for a condition, or a contributing cause for the condition. All edges are manual agent knowledge assertions, as the ingested data is based on manual literature curation.
   
### Node Types

High-level Biolink categories of nodes produced from this ingest as assigned by ingestors are listed below - however downstream normalization of node identifiers may result in new/different categories ultimately being assigned.

| Biolink Category |  Source Identifier Type(s) | Notes |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| ChemicalEntity |  MeSH  | Majority are Biolink SmallMolecules |
| DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature| MeSH | |

-  The chemical ID row is expected to need a 'MESH:' prefix added, with the disease identifier used as-is.
  
### Future Modeling Considerations (o)
- Revisit use of 'has_confidence_score' edge property if/when we refactor this part of the Biolink Model
- Revisit 'correlates_with_or_contributes_to' and 'treats_or_studied_or_applied_to_treat' predicates if/when we refactor modeling or conventions here.
