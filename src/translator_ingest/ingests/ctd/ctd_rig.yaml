    description: >-
      CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding
      about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides knowledge,
      manually curated from the literature, about chemicals and their relationship to
      other biological entities: chemical to gene/protein interactions plus chemical to
      disease and gene to disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional
      and pathway data to aid in the development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying
      environmentally influenced diseases. It also generates novel inferences by further
      analyzing the knowledge they curate/create - based on statistically significant connections
      with intermediate concept (e.g. Chemical X associated with Disease Y based on shared associations
      with a common set of genes).

    utility: >-
      CTD is a rich source of manually curated chemical associations to other biological entities
      which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including
      treatment predictions, chemical-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries. It is
      one of the few sources that focus on non-drug chemicals, e.g. environmental stressors, and
      how these are related to diseases, biological processes, and genes.
    scope: >-
      Covers a diverse range of Chemical association knowledge types provided across several files
      provided by CTD, based on many knowledge curation/creation approaches.

# TO DO: review included content description above for accuracy
# TO DO: I removed filtered content descriptions below, but add descriptions as needed to describe filtering done. 
# TO DO: Consider consolidating spec to allow descriptions of filtered content in the included_content objects (just add a filtered_content field (multivalued in case we need to describe >1 filter), and a rationale field) 

    future_considerations:  
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: For Chemical-Disease associations, consider adding a cutoff to remove lower quality/confidence inferences (e.g. based on shared gene count, publication count, or inference score). At present we include even inferences based on a single shared gene/pub - which is not really meaningful. Similar considerations for other types of inferred associations. 
        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
      - category:  edge_property_content
        consideration: Consider an edge property that reports the list of shared genes supporting C-D inferred associations.
        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
      - category: edge_content
        consideration: While the current ingest includes only Chemical-Disease Associations, future iterations will include additional types of associations between Chemicals and GO Terms, Molecular Phenotypes, Genes, etc. See the Ingest Survey table linked below for more details.
      - category: node_property_content
        consideration: Molepro ingested chemical properties in its previous ingests - which we will likely bring in at some point. In particular, data from the CTD_chemicals.tsv file

# Information about the Graph Output by the ingest

        agent_type:
          - manual_agent
        edge_properties:
          - publications
        ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with a "T" (therapeutic) DirectEvidence code indicate the chemical to be a "potential" treatment in virtue of its clinical use or study - which maps best to the Biolink predicate 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat'.
        additional_notes: source file(s): CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv. Note that the 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat' predicate is used to avoid making too strong a claim, as CTDs definition of its "T" flag is broad ("a chemical that has a known or potential therapeutic role in a disease"), which covered cases where a chemical may formally treat a disease or only have been studied or applied to treat a disease. All edges are manual agent knowledge assertions, as the ingested data is based on manual literature curation.

        edge_properties:
          - publications
        ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with a DirectEvidence code of "M" (marker/mechanism) indicate that the chemical is manually flagged as a marker or contributing factor for a condition. This implies that at minimum there is correlation between the presence of the chemical and condition, for which we use the Biolink 'correlated_with' predicate.

          - has_confidence_score
        ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with an inference score have a statistically significant number of shared gene associations that suggest a biological relationship may exist. The statistical basis of this general inferred relationship is best reported using the Biolink 'assocaited_with' predicate.

        ui_explanation: A positive or negative correlation edge is created when the results of an environmental exposure study curated by CTD reports a statistically significant association between the exposure (usually a chemical) and outcome measure (usually a disease or phenotype). Note that this edge is based on results from a single study.

      CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv. data includes one row per curated 'T', or 'M' association with pub reference(s), plus one row per shared gene association with pub reference(s), and inference scores.
      Separate edges will be created for each type of association reported between a chemical and a given disease, according to the mappings described above.
      All "shared gene" rows in the source data file for a given C-D pair will be aggregated into a single 'associated_with' edge that reports an associated_with relationship with the inference score as an edge property (and possibly the list of shared genes).
      This means that for a given C-D pair in the CTD file, there may be 1, 2, or 3 separate edges created in the Translator graph.
