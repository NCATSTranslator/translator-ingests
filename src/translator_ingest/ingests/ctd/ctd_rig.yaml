    description: >-
      CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding
      about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides knowledge,
      manually curated from the literature, about chemicals and their relationship to
      other biological entities: chemical to gene/protein interactions plus chemical to
      disease and gene to disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional
      and pathway data to aid in the development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying
      environmentally influenced diseases. It also generates novel inferences by further
      analyzing the knowledge they curate/create - based on statistically significant connections
      with intermediate concept (e.g. Chemical X associated with Disease Y based on shared associations
      with a common set of genes).

    utility: >-
      CTD is a rich source of manually curated chemical associations to other biological entities
      which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including
      treatment predictions, chemical-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries. It is
      one of the few sources that focus on non-drug chemicals, e.g. environmental stressors, and
      how these are related to diseases, biological processes, and genes.
    scope: >-
      Covers a diverse range of Chemical association knowledge types provided across several files
      provided by CTD, based on many knowledge curation/creation approaches.

    future_considerations:
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: We should ingest gene-disease association edges from the CTD_genes_diseases.tsv file and/or the curated CTD_curated_genes_diseases.tsv.gz file. Lots of content here. Assess quality and compare to other gene-disease association sources when we do a comprehensive review of content/modeling in this area.
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: For inferred Chemical-Disease associations, consider adding a cutoff to remove lower quality/confidence inferences (e.g. based on shared gene count, publication count, or inference score). At present we include even inferences based on a single shared gene/pub - which is not really meaningful.
        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: For enrichment-based Chemical-GO term associations, consider adding a cutoff to remove lower quality/confidence associations based on p-values.

        consideration: Consider an edge property that reports the list of shared genes supporting C-D inferred associations.
        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
      - category: node_property_content
        consideration: Molepro ingested chemical properties in its previous ingests - which we will likely bring in at some point. In particular, data from the CTD_chemicals.tsv file
        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals.tsv
      - category: edge_property_content
        consideration: The exposures event file provides a lot of provenance/evidence metadata about supporting studies, including characteristics of subject populations, location of the study, and experimental/statistical data values. Consider for inclusion using a StudyResult object.

        additional_notes: Note that the 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat' predicate is used to avoid making too strong a claim, as CTDs definition of its "T" flag is broad ("a chemical that has a known or potential therapeutic role in a disease"), which covered cases where a chemical may formally treat a disease or only have been studied or applied to treat a disease.

        transform_rationale: CTD Chemical-Disease records with a DirectEvidence code of "M" (marker/mechanism) indicate that the chemical is manually flagged as a marker or contributing factor for a condition. This implies that at minimum there is correlation between the presence of the chemical and condition, for which we use the Biolink 'correlated_with' predicate.

        transform_rationale: CTD Chemical-Disease records with an inference score have a statistically significant number of shared gene associations that suggest a biological relationship may exist. The statistical basis of this relationship is best reported using the Biolink 'associated_with' predicate.

        transform_rationale: A positive or negative correlation edge is created when the results of an environmental exposure study report curated by CTD indicates a statistically significant association between the exposure (usually a chemical) and outcome measure (usually a disease or phenotype). Note that this edge is based on results from a single study.

        klat_and_source_rationale: Statements are manually curated from literature, as performed by CTD curators.
        transform_rationale: CTD curators manually extract statements from publications about how chemicals affect processes, activities, or pathways in the body, often reporting the direction of the effect. Translator represents details of these causal associations using specific combinations of predicates (biolink:affects, biolink:causes) and qualifier properties (e.g. object_direction).

Translator reports this using the biolnk:associated_with predicate, and provides the p-value as supporting evidence.

    future_considerations:
      - category: edge_properties
        consideration: Revisit use of 'has_confidence_score' edge property if/when we refactor this part of the Biolink Model.
      - category: predicates
        consideration: Revisit 'correlated_with' and 'treats_or_studied_or_applied_to_treat' predicates if/when we refactor modeling or conventions here.
      - category: other
        consideration: May want to improve ui_explanations for the chemical-gene interactions edge types, once we understand how the UI will stitch together / display predicates and qualifier values for these edges.
      - category: edges
        consideration: CTD_pheno_term_ixns and CTD_chem_gene_ixns both have lots of interactions involve three entities, like A causes B which results in B causing C. These are hard to model on a single edge, but we may be able to extract single edges from them.
      - category: edges
        consideration: (related to the consdieration above) The CTD_pheno_term_ixns.tsv that links chemicals to phenotypes (post-composed from GO term + direction) includes a column indicating gene(s) mediating the phenotype.  Consider adding this info (perhaps using a new statement-level qualifier such as 'gene context qualifier', or 'mediating gene qualifier'.)

    additional_notes: >-
      CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv. data includes one row per curated 'T', or 'M' association with pub reference(s), plus one row per shared gene association with pub reference(s), and inference scores.
      Separate edges will be created for each type of association reported between a chemical and a given disease, according to the mappings described above.
      All "shared gene" rows in the source data file for a given C-D pair will be aggregated into a single '' edge that reports an  relationship with the inference score as an edge property (and possibly the list of shared genes).
      This means that for a given C-D pair in the CTD file, there may be 1, 2, or 3 separate edges created in the Translator graph.
