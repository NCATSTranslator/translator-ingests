    description: >-
      CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding
      about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides knowledge,
      manually curated from the literature, about chemicals and their relationship to
      other biological entities: chemical to gene/protein interactions plus chemical to
      disease and gene to disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional
      and pathway data to aid in the development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying
      environmentally influenced diseases. It also generates novel inferences by further
      analyzing the knowledge they curate/create - based on statistically significant connections
      with intermediate concept (e.g. Chemical X associated with Disease Y based on shared associations
      with a common set of genes).

    utility: >-
      CTD is a rich source of manually curated chemical associations to other biological entities
      which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including
      treatment predictions, chemical-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries. It is
      one of the few sources that focus on non-drug chemicals, e.g. environmental stressors, and
      how these are related to diseases, biological processes, and genes.
    scope: >-
      Covers a diverse range of Chemical association knowledge types provided across several files
      provided by CTD, based on many knowledge curation/creation approaches.

    future_considerations:
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: We should ingest gene-disease association edges from the CTD_genes_diseases.tsv file and/or the curated CTD_curated_genes_diseases.tsv.gz file. Lots of content here. Assess quality and compare to other gene-disease association sources when we do a comprehensive review of content/modeling in this area.
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: For inferred Chemical-Disease associations, consider adding a cutoff to remove lower quality/confidence inferences (e.g. based on shared gene count, publication count, or inference score). At present we include even inferences based on a single shared gene/pub - which is not really meaningful.
        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: For enrichment-based Chemical-GO term associations, consider adding a cutoff to remove lower quality/confidence associations based on p-values.

        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals.tsv
      - category: edge_property_content
        consideration: The exposures event file provides a lot of provenance/evidence metadata about supporting studies, including characteristics of subject populations, location of the study, and experimental/statistical data values. Consider for inclusion using a StudyResult object.

        ui_explanation: Source CTD data provides assertions about Chemical-Disease relationships that were manually curated from literature by CTD curators. The CTD record used to create this Translator edge has a "T" (therapeutic) as a DirectEvidence code, indicating the chemical to be a "potential" treatment in virtue of its clinical use or scientific study. The broad and imprecise nature of this relationship is best represented with the Biolink predicate 'treats or applied or studied to treat' - which is used when it is not clear whether the chemical shows established efficacy or was merely studied or attempted as a treatment.
        source_files:
          - CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv
        additional_notes: Note that the 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat' predicate is used to avoid making too strong a claim, as CTDs definition of its "T" flag is broad ("a chemical that has a known or potential therapeutic role in a disease"), which covered cases where a chemical may formally treat a disease or only have been studied or applied to treat a disease.

        ui_explanation: Source CTD data provides assertions about Chemical-Disease relationships that were manually curated from literature by CTD. The CTD record used to create this Translator edge has a 'DirectEvidence' code of "M" (marker/mechanism), indicating that the chemical is either a marker or contributing factor for a condition. This vague/imprecise relationship implies that at minimum there is correlation between the presence of the chemical and condition, and is best represented here using the Biolink 'correlated_with' predicate.
        source_files:
          - CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv
        additional_notes: CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv data includes one row per curated 'T', or 'M' association with pub reference(s), plus one row per shared gene association with pub reference(s), and inference scores. Separate edges will be created for each type of association reported between a chemical and a given disease, according to the mappings described above. All "shared gene" rows in the source data file for a given C-D pair will be aggregated into a single edge that reports a relationship with the inference score as an edge property (and possibly the list of shared genes). This means that for a given C-D pair in the CTD file, there may be 1, 2, or 3 separate edges created in the Translator graph.

        ui_explanation: "Source CTD data is based on statistical analysis of gene associations shared by a given Chemical-Diseae pair, as determined by an automated CTD pipeline that assigns an 'inference score' to each pair. The CTD record(s) used to create this Translator edge have an 'inference score' that indicates a statistically significant overrepresentation of shared gene associations between the Chemical and Disease. This hints but does not demonstrate that a real biological relationship may exist. The indirect, statistical basis of this relationship is best represented using the relatively generic 'associated_with' Biolink predicate."

        ui_explanation: "Source CTD data provides correlations between Chemicals and Disease based on a single real-world exposure study, that was curated from the literature by CTD curators. These correlations are separately calculated by authors or curators for each study, not an automated analysis pipeline. The CTD record used to create this Translator edge shows a statistically significant correlation between the studied exposure (usually a chemical) and a measured outcome (usually a disease or phenotype). This relationship is represented using the Biolink 'correlated with' predicate, or one of its directional sub-predicates if this information is provided ('positively/negatively correlated with'). Note that the edge is based on results from a single study - and may hold only in the context of the study's design or population."

This analysis is performed by a CTD automated analysis pipeline. The CTD record used to create this Translator edge reports an overrepresented GO term associated with a particular chemical - as indicated by a sufficiently low p-value from the analysis. This hints but does not directly demonstrate that the chemical may impact the process, activity, or cellular component the GO term represents. The indirect, statistical basis of this relationship is best represented using the 'associated_with' predicate in Biolink."

    future_considerations:
      - category: edge_properties
        consideration: Revisit use of 'has_confidence_score' edge property if/when we refactor this part of the Biolink Model.
      - category: predicates
        consideration: Revisit 'correlated_with' and 'treats_or_studied_or_applied_to_treat' predicates if/when we refactor modeling or conventions here.
      - category: other
        consideration: May want to improve ui_explanations for the chemical-gene interactions edge types, once we understand how the UI will stitch together / display predicates and qualifier values for these edges.
      - category: edges
        consideration: CTD_pheno_term_ixns and CTD_chem_gene_ixns both have lots of interactions involve three entities, like A causes B which results in B causing C. These are hard to model on a single edge, but we may be able to extract single edges from them.
      - category: edges
        consideration: (related to the consideration above) The CTD_pheno_term_ixns.tsv that links chemicals to phenotypes (post-composed from GO term + direction) includes a column indicating gene(s) mediating the phenotype.  Consider adding this info (perhaps using a new statement-level qualifier such as 'gene context qualifier', or 'mediating gene qualifier'.)
