# Jensen Lab DISEASES Database

---------------

## Source Information

### Infores
 - [infores:diseases](https://w3id.org/information-resource-registry/diseases)

### Description
The Diseases database is a web resource that integrates knowledge about on disease-gene associations. It generates de novo associations through automated text mining, and aggregates associations from external sources of manually curated knowledge and GWAS-based study results. The associations are assigned a confidence score to facilitate comparisons across data types and sources.

## Ingest Information
    
### Utility
DISEASES contains gene-disease associations from unique sources, including their own text-mining pipeline and external human-curated resources that are hard to access or parse (MedlinePlus, AmyCo). These associations could be used in MVP1 ("may treat disease X") or Pathfinder queries.

### Scope
This ingest covers text-mined co-occurrence associations, and manually curated associations Medline Plus and AmyCo. Content aggregated from UniProt is not ingested. Experiment-based associations from TIGA data are not ingested (we will find a direct source of GWAS-based associations - TIGA and / or something else).

  #### Relevant Files:

  | File | Location | Description |
  |----------|----------|----------|
  | human_disease_textmining_filtered.tsv  | https://diseases.jensenlab.org/Downloads |  Text mined associations, filtered to contain only the non-redundant associations that are shown within the web interface when querying for a gene | 
  | human_disease_knowledge_filtered.tsv  | https://diseases.jensenlab.org/Downloads | Curated associations, filtered to contain only the non-redundant associations that are shown within the web interface when querying for a gene | 
  
  #### Ingested Content:

  | File | Included Records | Fields Used | Filtered / Excluded Records | Rationale |
  |----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
  | human_disease_knowledge_filtered.tsv | G-D association records aggregated from Medline Plus and AmyCo sources |   gene_id,	gene_name, disease_id,	disease_name,	z_score, confidence_score,	url?  | G-D association records aggregated from UniProt | Questionable quality and completeness of Uniprot data in DISEASES - best to get this content directly from UniProt.|
  | human_disease_textmining_filtered.tsv | All G-D association records generated by their text-mining tool |   gene_id,	gene_name,	disease_id,	disease_name,	source_db,	evidence_type?,	confidence_score | None | Taking all records regardless of score. May decide to filter lower scoring assocaitions in the future. |


  #### Future Considerations (o):
- Revisit modeling of confidence score and z-score if/when we refactor these parts of the Biolink Model.
- Consider filtering some of the lower scoring text-mined associations if we can define a threshhold/cutoff.

### Edge Types

| # | Subject Category |  Predicate | Object Category | Qualifier Types |  AT / KL  | Edge Properties | UI Explanation |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Gene, Protein | occurs_together_in_literature_with | Disease  |  n/a  |  text-mining agent, statistical association | has_confidence_score, z-score, original_subject, original_object | The DISEASES text-mining method generates associations based on statistically significant co-occurrence of gene and disease concepts in the literature - which is consistent with the definition of the Biolink occurs_together_in_literature_with predicate. |
| Gene, Protein | associated_with | Disease |  n/a  |  manual_agent, knowledge_assertion  | has_confidence |  DISEASES does to attempt to report more specific types of gene-disease relationships that it aggregates from curated soruces, so the Biolink associated_with predicate is the most precise predicate we are able to use here. | 

**Notes/Rationale (o)**:

### Node Types

High-level Biolink categories of nodes produced from this ingest as assigned by ingestors are listed below - however downstream normalization of node identifiers may result in new/different categories ultimately being assigned.

| Biolink Category |  Source Identifier Type(s) | Node Properties | Notes |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------|---------|
| Gene | 	ENSEMBL  |  | Source uses the ENSP protein identifiers for Ensembl |
| Disease| DOID |  |  |


### Future Considerations (o)
- Revisit use of associated_with predicate for curated edges after we refactor this branch of the Biolink predicate hierarchy (if we reserve this predicate for statistically-based relationships, we may need to use 'related_to)
