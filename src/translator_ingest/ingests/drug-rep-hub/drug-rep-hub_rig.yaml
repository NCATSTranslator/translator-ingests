    description: >-
      The Drug Repurposing Hub is a curated and annotated collection of FDA-approved drugs, clinical trial drugs,
      and selected pre-clinical tool compounds. Because the compounds are annotated and well characterized, the 
      collection is a novel tool to explore known biological targets and pathways, and a powerful way to discover 
      new biological insights, better understand disease mechanisms, and discover new activities of existing molecules.
