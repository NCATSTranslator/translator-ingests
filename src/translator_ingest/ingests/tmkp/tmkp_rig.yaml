  description: |
    The Text Mining Knowledge Provider (TMKP) is a Translator knowledge provider that extracts
    biomedical assertions from scientific literature using advanced text mining techniques.
    It processes PubMed abstracts and full-text articles to identify relationships between
    biological entities such as chemicals, genes, diseases, and phenotypes. The system uses
    natural language processing and machine learning approaches to extract high-confidence
    assertions about how these entities interact.

  utility: |
    TMKP provides literature-mined assertions that complement manually curated knowledge sources.
    It enables discovery of relationships that may not be captured in structured databases,
    particularly for emerging research areas and novel connections between biological entities.
  scope: |
    Covers text-mined relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, and phenotypes
    extracted from PubMed literature. Each assertion includes supporting evidence from the
    source text and publication metadata.
