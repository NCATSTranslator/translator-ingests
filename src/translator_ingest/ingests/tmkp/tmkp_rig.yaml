  description: |
    The Text Mining Knowledge Provider (TMKP) is a Translator knowledge provider that extracts
    biomedical assertions from scientific literature using advanced text mining techniques.
    It processes PubMed abstracts and full-text articles to identify relationships between
    biological entities such as chemicals, genes, diseases, and phenotypes. The system uses
    natural language processing and machine learning approaches to extract high-confidence
    assertions about how these entities interact.

  utility:
    TMKP provides literature-mined assertions that complement manually curated knowledge sources.
    It enables discovery of relationships that may not be captured in structured databases,
    particularly for emerging research areas and novel connections between biological entities.
  scope:
    Covers text-mined relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, and phenotypes
    extracted from PubMed literature. Each assertion includes supporting evidence from the
    source text and publication metadata.

  filtered_content:
    - description: |
        Edges where subject/object ID prefixes violate Biolink Model domain/range constraints
        are excluded. This filters out reversed edges where diseases/phenotypes (MONDO, HP prefixes)
        are incorrectly positioned as subjects in ChemicalToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation
        edges with chemicals (DRUGBANK, CHEBI prefixes) as objects. For example, edges like
        "MONDO:xxx biolink:treats DRUGBANK:yyy" are excluded because the association type expects
        chemicals as subjects and diseases as objects, not the reverse. Validation uses BMT to
        dynamically determine valid ID prefixes for each association's domain/range constraints.
    - description: |
        GeneRegulatesGeneAssociation edges that lack required qualifiers (object_aspect_qualifier
        or object_direction_qualifier) are excluded to ensure semantic correctness of regulatory
        relationships.
  future_considerations:
    - |
      Review study results data and modeling (didn't have time to review thoroughly this pass),
      and it may be that we can simplify modeling depending on what requirements are for this
      type of metadata this phase.
    - |
      Consider whether it is sufficient to have RIG Edge Type objects be the source of truth
      for UI explanations, given that edges end up being generated in normalized KGs that don't
      fit into these categories. How to ensure that all edges in a KG will have an explanation,
      and that the UI team will be able to find and access and use these explanations easily
      and accurately.

      Approach for one-hop predictions like those described above (whether DINGO creates them
      at ingest, or re-instate the CQS to create them).
  additional_notes: |
    Attributes in the data are encoded as JSON objects that may contain nested attributes
    representing supporting studies and evidence. The ingest creates Study objects containing
    TextMiningStudyResult objects to model the nested study result data structure, with
    supporting text and document references captured in the TextMiningStudyResult objects.

The json examples to show the full nested study result objects under has_study_result, and the only nested properties here is publications and supporting_text. We should try to fix this up as I think some of the scores/metadata TMKP captures will be useful for scoring.

        Targeted text mining identified gene regulatory relationships where one protein affects
        another protein's activity or abundance. These edges include required qualifiers indicating
        the direction and magnitude of the regulatory effect.
