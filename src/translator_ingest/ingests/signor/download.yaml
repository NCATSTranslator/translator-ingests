## !!!! Note this data is complicated to download because the website uses php forms. This is currently not compatible

  local_name: all_data.tsv

##  Need to select "complete dataset" -> select "Homo sapiens" as organisms -> select "file tsv" as format
## the downloaded file's name will be all_data_<current date when downloaded>.tsv directly
