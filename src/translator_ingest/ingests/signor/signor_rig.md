### Description (o)
SIGNOR 3.0, https://signor.uniroma2.it, is a public repository that captures causal information and represents it according to an ‘activity-flow’ model. SIGNOR provides freely-accessible static maps of causal interactions that can be tailored, pruned and refined to build dynamic and predictive models. Each signaling relationship is annotated with an effect (up/down-regulation) and with the mechanism (e.g. binding, phosphorylation, transcriptional activation, etc.) causing the regulation of the target entity. Since its latest release, SIGNOR has undergone a significant upgrade including: (i) a new website that offers an improved user experience and novel advanced search and graph tools; (ii) a significant content growth adding up to a total of approx. 33,000 manually-annotated causal relationships between more than 8900 biological entities; (iii) an increase in the number of manually annotated pathways, currently including pathways deregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection or involved in neurodevelopment synaptic transmission and metabolism, among others; (iv) additional features such as new model to represent metabolic reactions and a new confidence score assigned to each interaction.

## Ingest Information

### Utility
Signor is a rich source of manually curated genetic  associations to other biological entities which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including treatment predictions, gene-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries.  It is one of the sources that focus on drug and genes.

### Scope
This initial ingest of Signor covers curated Gene to Gene associations that report therapeutic and marker/mechanism relationships, and inferred statistical associations generated by Signor.

### Relevant Files
Source files with content we aim to ingest.

  | File | Location | Description |
  |----------|----------|----------|
  | signor_genes.csv  | https://signor.uniroma2.it/downloads.php |   Associations generated by knowledge assertions between 'Gene' 'Complex' 'Chemical' 'Phenotype' 'Protein' 'Smallmolecule' 'Proteinfamily' 'Stimulus' 'Fusion Protein' 'Mirna' 'Antibody' and 'Ncrna' |

### Included Content / Records
Records from the relevant files that are included, and optionally a list of fields in the data that are part of or inform the ingest.

  | File | Included Records | Fields Used (o) |
  |----------|----------|----------|
  | signor_genes.csv | Associations generated by knowledge assertions with quality controlled edges between 'Gene' 'Complex' 'Chemical' 'Phenotype' 'Protein' 'Smallmolecule' 'Proteinfamily' 'Mirna' 'Antibody' and 'Ncrna' | subject_identifier	subject_name	subject_category	object_identifier	object_name	object_category	predicate	original_predicate	provided_by	Primary_Knowledge_Source	publications	knowledge_level |

### Filtered Content / Records
Records from relevant files that are not included in the ingest.

  | File | Filtered Records | Rationale |
  |----------|----------|----------|
  |None  | None | None |


### Future Content Considerations (o)
Content additions/changes to consider for future iterations (consider edge content node property content, and edge property/EPC content)

- **Edges**
   - While the current ingest includes only edges passing initial quality control of LLM & manual verification, future iterations will include additional edges fail initial quality control.
  - Considering add new biolink categories:
  - 'Fusion Protein': potential descendant to 'biolink:Protein'
  - 'Stimulus': only partially overlap with 'biolink:EnvironmentalProcess'

- **Node Properties**
  - N/A

- **Edge Properties/EPC Metadata**
  - N/A

### Node Types

High-level Biolink categories of nodes produced from this ingest as assigned by ingestors are listed below - however downstream normalization of node identifiers may result in new/different categories ultimately being assigned.
