  description: "SIGNOR 3.0, https://signor.uniroma2.it, is a public repository that captures causal information and represents it according to an 'activity-flow' model. SIGNOR provides freely-accessible static maps of causal interactions that can be tailored, pruned and refined to build dynamic and predictive models. Each signaling relationship is annotated with an effect (up/down-regulation) and with the mechanism (e.g. binding, phosphorylation, transcriptional activation, etc.) causing the regulation of the target entity. Since its latest release, SIGNOR has undergone a significant upgrade including: (i) a new website that offers an improved user experience and novel advanced search and graph tools; (ii) a significant content growth adding up to a total of approx. 33,000 manually-annotated causal relationships between more than 8900 biological entities; (iii) an increase in the number of manually annotated pathways, currently including pathways deregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection or involved in neurodevelopment synaptic transmission and metabolism, among others; (iv) additional features such as new model to represent metabolic reactions and a new confidence score assigned to each interaction."

  utility: "Signor is a rich source of manually curated genetic associations to other biological entities which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including treatment predictions, gene-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries. It is one of the sources that focus on drug and genes."
  scope: "This initial ingest of Signor covers manually curated causal associations between proteins, protein families, complexes, small molecules (mainly endogenous chemical entities) and chemicals (mainly non-endogenous chemical entities), as well as parthood edges associations between proteins and complexes, and physical interaction associations that can be inferred from certain mechanisms of action in the SIGNOR dataset."

  # future_considerations:
  #   - category: edge_content
  #     consideration: "Consider implementing some initial quality control of LLM to flag potential mismatch in concept name and identifier or edge types without literature support in source data and follow up with manual verification to confirm"
  #   - category: edge_content
  #     consideration: "Consider ingest of causal associations involving stimulus, fusion protein, mirna, antibody, phenotype, and ncrna entity types - which may require new Biolink classes and/or modeling work."
  #   - category: edge_property_content
  #     consideration: "Consider ingesting the \"DIRECT"\ column to be able to represent whether the causal association is mediated directly, or indirectly - may require new Biolink modeling to support this."
  #   - category: edge_content
  #     consideration: "Consider ingesting the Pathways data from SIGNOR, and using it for one or both of the following purposes: (1) edges linking Entities in causal associations to Pathways they participate in; (2) capturing the pathways in which the each causal association occurs, using a pathway_context_qualifier property (would need to add this to Biolink)."

    - category: edge_content
      consideration: Note that fact that X modifies Y (e.g. phosphorylates) is represented indirectly here, by an 'affects' predicate plus a mechanism qualifier that captures the type of modification.  Do we want a more direct edge (e.g. X phosphorylates Y) to be created at ingest?  Or derived afterward? Or perhaps live only in a 'predicate-semantics' KG derived from the primary 'qualifier-semantics' KG)?
