      ui_explanation: "Source DGIdb data aggregates drug-gene interaction statements of different types (e.g. 'antagonist', blocker', inhibitor', 'unknown') from several external knowledgebases. An automated algorithm assigns an 'interaction score' to each unique drug-gene pair across aggregated records. In performing this aggregation and 'meta-assessment', DGIdb makes its own implicit claims about each interaction, which are captured in Translator edges. The record(s) used to create this particular edge have a DGIdb 'interaction_type' that is empty or explicitly reported as 'other/unknown' - and thus assert only that an interaction of some type is occurring. This relationship is represented using the broadly-scoped Biolink 'interacts with' predicate."
      source_files:
        - interactions.tsv
     additional_notes: "More detail about the provenance of DGIdb-based edges: Source Drug-Gene records in DGIdb represent a single interaction statement that DGIdb ingested from an external source. There may be multiple records in DGIdb reporting an interaction between the same drug and gene, ingested from different sources, which may have different 'interaction_types' (e.g. 'antagonist', blocker', inhibitor'). An automated DGIdb scoring algorithm assesses all ingested records about the same drug-gene pair (regardless of interaction_type), to provide a single score that is applied to all assessed records. This assessment implies an aggregate interaction claim from DGIdb to which this score applies. Translator's ingest of DGIdb creates separate edges for each interaction_type for a given drug-gene pair - and records all of the upstream sources that asserted this, along with the dgiDB assign score (as applicable). Because DGIdb interprets source statements as evidence in assigning its aggregate score, is considered the primary knowledge source for the Translator edge, and its upstream sources are supporting data sources. Because DGIdb socring assessment is automated, the 'agent type' is automated_agent. Because the statements aggregated and assessed by DGIdb are typically curated assertions, the 'knowledge level' is knowlege_assertion."

      consideration: "It's unclear what the 'NCI' value in the interaction_source_db_name column stands for (not mentioned in the current DGIdb website and the 2024 paper is unclear). We think it refers to NCIt, so we mapped it to NCIt's infores. Notes: (1) NCI is an organization, not an information resource; (2) Matt suggested that we could instead map it to 'NCI enterprise vocabulary services' to cover 'the more expansive suite of terminologies / knowledgebases / services NCI provides'."
    - category: other
      consideration: "Matt said underlying-source licensing and data overlap with 'directly-ingested' resources are not concerns because DGIdb is an 'interpreter' and can be set as the primary source (with the underlying sources set to supporting data providers or publications). HOWEVER, if we are directly ingesting all underlying sources for an edge, the DGIdb edge then seems like extraneous duplication."

  additional_notes: "(1) Edge provenance: primary source is DGIdb, and the underlying sources are supporting data providers or publications. (2) We couldn't generate links to DGIdb interaction webpages because they use an ID that looks random or like a hash (and links to the drug or gene can currently be generated but wouldn't be specific to the edge)."
