However, according to the 2024 paper, DGIdb 'aggregate[s] content from...sources with varying content licenses'; and the DGIdb downloads page says 'some of the data sources we import may have restrictions that prevent us from redistributing them'."

      consideration: "interactions.tsv has some columns that could be ingested as node properties: drug_is_approved, drug_is_immunotherapy, drug_is_antineoplastic, drug_specificity_score, gene_specificity_score.

    - category: other
      consideration: "According to others that worked with DGIdb in the past, there's a way to load a local database that has more information. However, I looked at the Github instructions for recreating the database locally, and I don't think this can be easily/automatically done by the Translator ingest pipeline."

      consideration: "'immunotherapy' interaction_type: its full meaning isn't captured in the current qualifier-pattern because there were some concerns with using causal_mechanism_qualifier. In the future, we could try representing this using existing or new qualifiers (therapeutic context?)."
    - category: other
      consideration: "It's unclear what the 'NCI' value in the interaction_source_db_name column stands for (not mentioned in the current DGIdb website and the 2024 paper is unclear). We think it refers to NCIt, so we mapped it to NCIt's infores. Notes: (1) NCI is an organization, not an information resource; (2) Matt suggested that we could instead map it to 'NCI enterprise vocabulary services' to cover 'the more expansive suite of terminologies / knowledgebases / services NCI provides'."
    - category: other
      consideration: "Matt said underlying-source licensing and data overlap with 'directly-ingested' resources are not concerns because DGIdb is an 'interpreter' and can be set as the primary source (with the underlying sources set to supporting data providers or publications). HOWEVER, if we are directly ingesting all underlying sources for an edge, the DGIdb edge then seems like extraneous duplication."

  additional_notes: "(1) Edge provenance: primary source is DGIdb, and the underlying sources are supporting data providers or publications. (2) We couldn't generate links to DGIdb interaction webpages because they use an ID that looks random or like a hash (and links to the drug or gene can currently be generated but wouldn't be specific to the edge)."
