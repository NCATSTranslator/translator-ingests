  description: >-
    "The NCBI Gene integrates information from a wide range of species.
    A record may include nomenclature, Reference Sequences (RefSeqs), maps, pathways, variations, phenotypes,
    and links to genome-, phenotype-, and locus-specific resources worldwide."

  utility: >-
    "NCBI Gene provides authoritative gene information for human, mouse, and rat genes, including official gene
    symbols, descriptions, and taxonomic information critical for gene normalization and identification in
    biomedical knowledge graphs."
  scope: >-
    "This ingest focuses on human (NCBITaxon:9606), mouse (NCBITaxon:10090), and rat (NCBITaxon:10116)
    genes only from the gene_info.gz file. All gene records for these species are included to provide
    comprehensive gene coverage."

  relevant_files:
    - file_name: "gene_info.gz"
      location: "https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene_info.gz"
      description: "Tab-delimited file containing gene information for all NCBI species, filtered to human, mouse, and rat genes"

  included_content:
    - file_name: "gene_info.gz"
      included_records: "Gene records for human (taxon ID 9606), mouse (taxon ID 10090), and rat (taxon ID 10116) only"
      fields_used: "tax_id, GeneID, Symbol, description, Full_name_from_nomenclature_authority"

  filtered_content:
    - file_name: "gene_info.gz"
      filtered_records: "All gene records for species other than human, mouse, and rat"
      rationale: "This ingest focuses specifically on human, mouse, and rat genes as these are the primary model organisms of interest for biomedical research and translation."

  future_considerations:
    - category: node_content
      consideration: "Consider expanding to include additional model organisms (e.g., zebrafish, fly, worm, yeast) if needed for broader comparative genomics support"
      relevant_files: "gene_info.gz (additional taxon IDs)"
    - category: node_property_content
      consideration: "Consider adding additional gene properties such as map_location, chromosome, synonyms, or dbXrefs for richer gene annotation"

  additional_notes: "The NCBI Gene ingest provides foundational gene nodes that serve as authoritative identifiers and basic properties for downstream integration with other biomedical data sources."
