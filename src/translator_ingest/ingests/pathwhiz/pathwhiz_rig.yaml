  utility: "Comprehensive pathway membership and mechanistic process data (reactions, transports, interactions) for Translator reasoning and pathway-centric analytics."
  scope: "This ingest uses only two inputs: the master pathways CSV for biolink:Pathway nodes and the PWML archive for entities, processes, and edges."

    - file_name: "pathbank_all_pathways.csv.zip"
      location: "https://pathbank.org/downloads"
      description: "Master CSV with pathway subjects and descriptions; used to build Pathway nodes with IDs, names, descriptions, and species metadata."

      included_records: "All pathway rows extracted to pathbank_pathways.csv"
      fields_used: "pathway_id, pathway_name, description, species/taxon, external references if present"
    - file_name: "pathbank_all_pwml.zip"
      included_records: "All PWML pathway files"
      fields_used: "entities (compounds, proteins, complexes, nucleic acids), processes (reactions, transports, interactions), participants (inputs/outputs), enzymes/transporters, localization (compartments/tissues)"

  # FOR ADIL : Per the schema definition here (https://biolink.github.io/resource-ingest-guide-schema/FilteredContent/), 
  # the 'filtered content' object describes a subset of records from the included files that are excluded from the ingest by some filtering logic.
  # Not describe other formats or files that were not used.  If this info is relevant however, if should be documented in the scope field above. 
  filtered_content: 
    - file_name: "Other formats (BioPAX, SBML, SBGN, RXN, SVG, PNG, FASTA, SDF)"
      filtered_records: "Excluded to enforce two-file ingest constraint; may be added later for enrichment"
      rationale: "This RIG intentionally limits inputs to the master pathways CSV and PWML for parity with the SMPDB-style ETL while ensuring semantic completeness."
