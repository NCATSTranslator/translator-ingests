#
# BindingDb data is in a huge tab-delimited file with 640 columns and truncated data rows
# therefore, we don't ask Koza to directly ingest it following a reader specification
# but instead directly access and pre-process the downloaded file in the
# @koza.prepare_data() decorated method of the parser, which uses polars to read the file.
#
#reader:
#  format: "csv"
#  delimiter: "\t"
#  header_mode: 0
#  files:
#    - "BindingDB_All_current_tsv.zip"
#  columns:
#    - BindingDB MonomerID
#    - PubChem CID
#    - Target Name
#    - UniProt (SwissProt) Primary ID of Target Chain 1
#    - Curation/DataSource
#    - Article DOI
#    - PMID
#    - Patent Number
#
#     The above is a sparse harvesting of the ~640 BindingDb data columns.
#     We assume that the remaining columns may be ignored for now?
#
# Unsure if we need a filter here to just get human data?

#    - inclusion: 'include'

#        - 'Homo sapiens'
