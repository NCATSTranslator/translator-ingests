# BindingDb data is in a huge tab-delimited file with 640 columns and truncated data rows
# therefore, we don't ask Koza to directly ingest it following a reader specification
# but instead directly access and pre-process the downloaded file in the
# @koza.prepare_data() decorated method of the parser, which uses polars to read the file.
