  description: The Binding Database ("BindingDb") is a public, web-accessible database
    of measured binding affinities, focusing chiefly on the interactions of protein
    considered to be drug-targets with small, drug-like molecules. As of July 31,
    2021, BindingDB contains thousands of dataset Entries, each with a DOI,
    containing millions of binding assay results for thousands of protein targets
    assayed against over a million distinct small molecule ligands.

      The units of these kinetic parameters are nM. 
      Lower values imply stronger binding affinity
      or functional effects. Imposing a threshold
      focuses on the most relevant interactions.
      For Ki, IC50, EC50, the value relates to
      the concentration of ligand (or drug) 
      needed to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity.
      Kon and Koff rates are, respectively, the rate
      which a ligand binds and dissociates from a protein.
      The ratio of Koff/Kon is Kd, the binding affinity
      between a ligand and its target.
