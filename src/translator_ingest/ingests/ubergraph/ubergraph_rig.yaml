  name: Ubergraph
  description: "Ubergraph is a unified OWL ontology integrating multiple biomedical ontologies including GO, UBERON, CL, CHEBI, HP, and others. It provides both redundant (with full inference closure for subclass relations) and non-redundant graph representations. This ingest uses the redundant version which contains complete transitive, reflexive subclass relations for ontological hierarchy reasoning."

  utility: "Ubergraph provides comprehensive ontological relationships essential for Translator's reasoning capabilities. The complete inference closure enables ontology-based query expansion, ancestor/descendant lookups, and semantic similarity calculations. These hierarchical relationships are fundamental for mapping between different levels of biological granularity and supporting TRAPI queries that require ontological reasoning."
  scope: "This ingest focuses on the redundant graph which includes all subclass (rdfs:subClassOf) relationships with full transitive closure. The graph contains nodes and edges from integrated ontologies represented as CURIEs, enabling seamless integration with other Translator knowledge sources."

  included_content:
    - file_name: "redundant-graph-table.tgz"
      included_records: "Subclass (rdfs:subClassOf) edges where both subject and object are from selected biomedical ontologies"
      fields_used: "subject_id, predicate_id, object_id (mapped via node-labels.tsv and edge-labels.tsv)"
      ontology_prefixes_included: "UBERON, CL, GO, CHEBI, PR, NCIT, HPO, MONDO, RO, SO, MP, PATO, ECTO, ENVO, OBI, MAXO, ECO, NCBITAXON, FOODON, MI, UO"

  filtered_content:
    - file_name: "redundant-graph-table.tgz"
      filtered_records: "Edges where subject, predicate, or object IRIs cannot be mapped to CURIEs"
      rationale: "CURIE conversion is essential for integration with Translator infrastructure. IRIs that cannot be mapped lack appropriate prefix mappings in Biolink Model, OBO, or custom converters."
    - file_name: "redundant-graph-table.tgz"
      filtered_records: "All non-subClassOf predicates (e.g., part_of, has_part, regulates, etc.)"
      rationale: "Initial focus on hierarchical subclass relationships only. Other predicate types may be added in future iterations."
    - file_name: "redundant-graph-table.tgz"
      filtered_records: "Edges involving ontology terms not in the selected prefix list (e.g., non-biomedical ontologies, deprecated terms)"
      rationale: "Focused on core biomedical ontologies most relevant to Translator use cases. Reduces graph size from 90+ million edges to ~2-3 million while maintaining comprehensive biomedical coverage."

  future_considerations:
    - category: edge_content
      consideration: "Consider creating separate ingests for specific predicate types (e.g., rdfs:subClassOf only for strict ontological hierarchy)"
    - category: node_property_content
      consideration: "Ubergraph provides node descriptions via SPARQL query (IAO_0000115 definitions). These could be added as node properties in future iterations."
    - category: edge_property_content
      consideration: "Additional edge properties from OWL axiom annotations could be included to provide provenance and context for ontological relationships"
    - category: other
      consideration: "Evaluate ingesting the non-redundant graph as a separate resource for users who need only direct asserted relationships without inference closure"

      additional_notes: "Nodes represent ontology terms from selected biomedical ontologies integrated into Ubergraph. In the raw ingest, all nodes are assigned the generic biolink:NamedThing category. NodeNormalization subsequently enriches these nodes with more specific Biolink categories (e.g., biolink:Disease, biolink:ChemicalEntity, biolink:AnatomicalEntity, biolink:BiologicalProcess, biolink:CellularComponent, biolink:MolecularActivity, biolink:PhenotypicFeature) based on the ontology prefix and internal mappings. This normalization step provides proper semantic typing for downstream Translator operations."
