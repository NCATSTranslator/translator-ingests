  description: "Ubergraph is a unified OWL ontology integrating multiple biomedical ontologies including GO, UBERON, CL, CHEBI, HP, and others. It provides both redundant (with full inference closure for subclass and existential relations) and non-redundant graph representations. This ingest uses the redundant version which contains complete transitive, reflexive subclass relations for ontological hierarchy reasoning."

  utility: "Ubergraph provides comprehensive ontological relationships essential for Translator's reasoning capabilities. The complete inference closure enables ontology-based query expansion, ancestor/descendant lookups, and semantic similarity calculations. These hierarchical relationships are fundamental for mapping between different levels of biological granularity and supporting TRAPI queries that require ontological reasoning."
  scope: "This ingest focuses on the redundant graph which includes all subclass (rdfs:subClassOf) relationships and other ontological predicates with full transitive closure. The graph contains nodes and edges from integrated ontologies represented as CURIEs, enabling seamless integration with other Translator knowledge sources."

  included_content:
    - file_name: "redundant-graph-table.tgz"
      included_records: "All edges from edges.tsv with successfully mapped subject, predicate, and object CURIEs"
      fields_used: "subject_id, predicate_id, object_id (mapped via node-labels.tsv and edge-labels.tsv)"

  filtered_content:
    - file_name: "redundant-graph-table.tgz"
      filtered_records: "Edges where subject, predicate, or object IRIs cannot be mapped to CURIEs"
      rationale: "CURIE conversion is essential for integration with Translator infrastructure. IRIs that cannot be mapped lack appropriate prefix mappings in Biolink Model, OBO, or custom converters."

  future_considerations:
    - category: edge_content
      consideration: "Consider creating separate ingests for specific predicate types (e.g., rdfs:subClassOf only for strict ontological hierarchy)"
    - category: node_property_content
      consideration: "Ubergraph provides node descriptions via SPARQL query (IAO_0000115 definitions). These could be added as node properties in future iterations."
    - category: edge_property_content
      consideration: "Additional edge properties from OWL axiom annotations could be included to provide provenance and context for ontological relationships"
    - category: other
      consideration: "Evaluate ingesting the non-redundant graph as a separate resource for users who need only direct asserted relationships without inference closure"
