    The [Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)](https://hpo.jax.org/) provides a 
    standard vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease.
    Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality, such as Atrial septal defect. 
    The HPO is currently being developed using the medical literature, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM. 
    HPO currently contains over 18,000 terms and over 156,000 annotations to hereditary diseases. 
    The HPO project and others have developed software for phenotype-driven differential diagnostics,
    genomic diagnostics, and translational research.
    
    The Human Phenotype Ontology group curates and assembles over 115,000 HPO-related annotations ("HPOA")
    to hereditary diseases using the HPO ontology. Here we create Biolink associations between diseases
    and phenotypic features, together with their evidence, and age of onset and frequency (if known).
    Disease annotations here are also cross-referenced to the MONarch Disease Ontology (MONDO)
    (https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/).

    There are four HPOA ingests ('disease-to-phenotype' (includes capture of disease modes of inheritance,
    'gene-to-phenotype' and 'gene-to-disease') that parse out records from the 
    HPO Phenotype Annotation File (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp/hpoa/phenotype.hpoa).

    The HPO and associated annotations are a flagship product of the Monarch Initiative 
    (https://monarchinitiative.org/), an NIH-supported international consortium dedicated
    to semantic integration of biomedical and model organism data with the ultimate goal
    of improving biomedical research. The human phenotype/disease/gene knowledge integration
    aligns well with the general mission of the Biomedical Data Translator.  As a consequence,
    several members of the Monarch Initiative are direct participants in the Biomedical Data Translator,
    with Monarch data forming one primary knowledge source contributing to Translator knowledge graphs.
  scope:
    Covers curated Disease, Phenotype and Genes relationships annotated with Human Phenotype Ontology terms.

        Records where we determine that the reported G-P association was inferred
        over a G-D associated type with the value "POLYGENIC" or "UNKNOWN"
      rationale: >-
        HPO will infer a Gene-Phenotype association G1-P1 in cases where G1 causes,
        contributes_to, or is associated with D1, and D1 is associated with a Phenotype P1.
        This logic holds for Mendelian disease where a single gene is causal and thus
        responsible for all associated phenotypes. It does not necessarily hold for 
        Polygenic or Unknown diseases where the gene may be one of many contributing factors,
        and thus does not necessarily contribute to or have an association with each phenotype of the disease.

      Consider bringing back G-P associations based on inferences over
      Unknown Diseases if we establish a confidence annotation paradigm
      that lets us indicate these inferences to be weaker than those
      inferred over Mendelian or Polygenic diseases where the Gene is
      individually causal for, or contributing to, the disease.

        Source HPOA data provide Disease-Phenotype associations that are produced by
        HPO curators through manual review of clinical data and published evidence.
        The HPOA record used to create this Translator edge reports that a Phenotype
        is observed to manifest in a particular Disease, and may include information about
        the frequency and/or biological context (e.g. sex, onset) of this manifestation.
        This relationship is represented using the Biolink 'has phenotype' predicate -
        with optional qualifiers describing frequency/context information where provided.

        Source HPOA data provide Gene-Disease associations that are manually curated from
        sources like Orphanet and MIM2Gene and DECIPHER by HPO. The record used to create
        this Translator edge reports that a Gene is associated with a Disease when there
        is evidence that variants in the gene may cause or contribute to its manifestation.
        The Biolink predicate used to represent this relationship depends on the type of 
        Disease. For Mendelian disorders (where the HPOA "association_type" field = 'MENDELIAN')
        'contributes to' is the primary predicate and the 'causes' predicate is used as the
        'qualified predicate'.  For polygenic disease (where the "association_type" field = "POLYGENIC")
        'correlated with' is the primary predicate and the 'contributes to' predicate is used as the
        'qualified predicate'. Qualifier is used to indicate that it is a 'genetic_variant_form'
        of the gene that participates in these relationships, not the Gene in general.

        Source HPOA data provide direct Gene-Phenotype associations that are automatically
        assigned between a Gene and any Phenotype that manifests in a Mendelian Disease
        associated with the Gene. The record used to create this edge specifically reports a
        Gene-Phenotype association where the Gene has variants causal for a Mendelian disorder
        in which the Phenotype is manifest - from which it is logically entailed that
        variants in the Gene are also causal for the Phenotype (as such disorders have a
        single causal gene). This relationship is represented using the Biolink 'causes' predicate,
        with a qualifier indicating that it is a 'genetic_variant_form' of the gene that is
        causing the Phenotype (not the Gene in general)."
