# HPOA Ingest Things to Do

- review the latest ingest project templates for any changes to method protocols and expectations
- review rig.md once more to see if expectations are fully met in the ingest code
- document potential sharable code snippets and perhaps, move them to a more shared location; communicate to the team; check other ingests for similar code snippets and coordinates consolidation with other teammates
