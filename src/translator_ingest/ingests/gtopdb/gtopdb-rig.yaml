  description: "The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb; https://www.guidetopharmacology.org) is an open-access, expert-curated, online
database that provides succinct overviews and key references for pharmacological targets and their recommended experimental ligands. It
includes over 3039 protein targets and 12,163 ligand molecules, including approved drugs, small molecules, peptides and antibodies. GtoPdb) was established
and developed by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS).
It originated from the IUPHAR-DB, a former resource focused on receptors and channels that was first compiled in 2003 and from the
BPS‘ Guide to Receptors and Channels’, a compendium of a wider range of targets than those originally covered in IUPHAR-DB"
