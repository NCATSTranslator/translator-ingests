  name: The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb)
  description: "The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb; https://www.guidetopharmacology.org) is an open-access, expert-curated, online
database that provides succinct overviews and key references for pharmacological targets and their recommended experimental ligands. It
includes over 3039 protein targets and 12,163 ligand molecules, including approved drugs, small molecules, peptides and antibodies. GtoPdb) was established
and developed by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS).
It originated from the IUPHAR-DB, a former resource focused on receptors and channels that was first compiled in 2003 and from the
BPS‘ Guide to Receptors and Channels’, a compendium of a wider range of targets than those originally covered in IUPHAR-DB"

# MHB: Content of the included_records field above is not really what we look for here. See suggested text below - confirm its accuracy.
      included_records: No filtering. Records for all species included.  Note however that records in the data describe results of a single published experiment. In our ingest records with the same ligand, target, and type + action are merged into a single edge, and metadata from each merged record (publications) combined into a list and attached to the edge.
      fields_used: "Ligand Id, Target Species, Type, Target Ensembl Gene ID"      # MHB:  'Action' and 'Pubmed ID' and 'Endogenous' fields should also be used, right?

# MHB: Qi, can you update included_records and fields_used in objects below to match conventions / suggestions above. Remember, the ingest_info section of the RIG just describes what content we take from the source, and what we leave behind.  It doesn't describe how we model it. THat goes in the target_info section that follows.

    - category: edge_content
      consideration: "Consider ingest peptides.csv with species other than Human"
# MHB: I added this future consideration as well, which is an important one
    - category: edge_property_content
      consideration: "Longer term, consider creating ExperimentalStudyResult objects to capture metadata for each experiment that supports an edge (e.g. affinity data, assay descriptions, and associated publications)"
