      DrugCentral is an open-access, manually curated drug information resource developed/maintained by the Translational Informatics Division at the University of New Mexico. 
      It provides  information about drug active pharmaceutical ingredients (for human and increasingly veterinary use), including chemical structure, regulatory status,
      pharmacology, target biology, indications, adverse events, and more. The majority of knowledge in DrugCentral is manually curated - either by the DrugCentral team, or 
      by external sources from which DrugCentral imports (and vets) data.

    scope: Curated drug bioactivities (interaction/affect on biological targets) and therapeutic relationships to diseases 
    utility: Drug bioactivities (interaction/affect on biological targets) and therapeutic relationships to diseases are core Translator knowledge types key to its query use cases.

        included_records:   Only ingested records where there is a MoA, and the source is not Chembl or GtoPdb (b/c we get these directly).  This is because these without MoA are primarily based on curation or import of experimental data and Vlado does not think the Kd/Ki/IC50 values reported are always indicative of a meaningful interaction.  If we want to take these we need to establish some rules / thresholds for what qualifies as a meaningful interaction.

          The 'mechanism of action' reported by DrugCentral determines that type of edge is created: (1) an 'affects' edge when the mechanism implies an effect of the subject on the object - e.g. 'positive modulator' implies that 'A causes increased activity of B'; a 'directly_physically_interacts_with' edge when the mechanism implies only that the subject interacts with B, but not an effect that results from this - e.g. 'binding agent' implies only a physical interaction; (or (3) both 'affects' and 'directly_physically_interacts_with' edges, when the mechanism implies an effect that is necessarily mediated through a direct physical interaction - e.g. 'antagonist' implies that 'A decreases the activity of B' and that 'A directly physically interacts with B'. A full mapping of these Drug Central mechanisms to Biolink predicate and qualifier combinations can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DeAE04O1mz3R9s3dCZpG2hQp9hwif5WjdkUMsBci-u8/edit?gid=392679103#gid=392679103.
           Primary knowledge source set to DrugCentral, and sources reported in 'bioactivity source' or 'moa source' columns by DrugCentral are reported as supporting data sources. This is because they often do things like combine bioactivity info with MoA info from different sources into a new record - which would make it impossible to reporting a single upstream source as primary.
