      DrugCentral is an open-access, manually curated drug information resource developed/maintained by the Translational Informatics Division at the University of New Mexico.
      It provides  information about drug active pharmaceutical ingredients (for human and increasingly veterinary use), including chemical structure, regulatory status,
      pharmacology, target biology, indications, adverse events, and more. The majority of knowledge in DrugCentral is manually curated - either by the DrugCentral team, or
      by external sources from which DrugCentral imports (and vets) data.

    scope: Curated drug bioactivities (interaction/affect on biological targets) and therapeutic relationships to diseases
    utility: Drug bioactivities (interaction/affect on biological targets) and therapeutic relationships to diseases are core Translator knowledge types key to its query use cases.

        included_records:   Only ingested records where there is an ACTION_TYPE value, and the ACT_SOURCE is not Chembl or GtoPdb (b/c we get these directly).  This is because recrods without ACTION_TYPES are based on import/curation of experimental data and Vlado does not think the Kd/Ki/IC50 values reported are always indicative of a meaningful interaction.  If we want to include these records, we need to establish some rules / thresholds for what qualifies as a meaningful interaction.

          The 'mechanism of action' reported by DrugCentral determines that type of edge is created: (1) an 'affects' edge when the mechanism implies an effect of the subject on the object - e.g. 'positive modulator' implies that 'A causes increased activity of B'; a 'directly_physically_interacts_with' edge when the mechanism implies only that the subject interacts with B, but not an effect that results from this - e.g. 'binding agent' implies only a physical interaction; (or (3) both 'affects' and 'directly_physically_interacts_with' edges, when the mechanism implies an effect that is necessarily mediated through a direct physical interaction - e.g. 'antagonist' implies that 'A decreases the activity of B' and that 'A directly physically interacts with B'. A full mapping of these Drug Central mechanisms to Biolink predicate and qualifier combinations can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DeAE04O1mz3R9s3dCZpG2hQp9hwif5WjdkUMsBci-u8/edit?gid=392679103#gid=392679103.
           Drug Central is mainly an aggregator here - so the primary knowledge source set to the resource reported as the “ACT_SOURCE” (except where the ACT_SOURCE is "scientific literature" - in which case DrugCentral is PKS as their curators pulled it from a publication). Note that the MOA_SOURCE isn’t relevant because this pertains to whether the reported bioactivity is the therapeutic mechanism, but we don’t capture this info in our edge.

          DrugCentral.indication, symptomatic_treatment, and off_label-use -> biolink:treats (reading of DrugCentral papers suggested that 'off-label use' reports are generally based on widely established clinical use, not just anecdotal reports. Given the definition of 'biolink:treats', this warranting a 'biolink:treats' mapping - which also sets these apart from 'applied to treat' edges based on anecdotal/patient self-report data from sources like faers)

          DrugcCentral.contraindication -> biolink:contraindicated_in
          DrugCentral.diagnosis -> biolink.diagnoses (or just drop these, only a couple records, and not very useful?)
          Agent type set to “manual validation of automated agent” based on use in some cases of some NLP tools to help initially identify drug/disease cocnepts in source text, which is followed by manualy review/curation.
