  name: Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES) KGX dataset
  description: ICEES KG is the KG version of the Integrated Clinical and Environmental
    Exposures Service (ICEES), which provides regulatory-compliant open access to
    clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, survey data, clinical research
    data) that have been integrated at the patient level with environmental exposures
    data (e.g., airborne pollutants, landfills, concentrated animal feeding operations,
    socio-economic indicators).
