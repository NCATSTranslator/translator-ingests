  description: >-
    "The Text Mining Knowledge Provider (TMKP) is an automated knowledge extraction system that analyzes
    biomedical literature to identify associations between biological entities. It uses natural language
    processing and machine learning techniques to extract relationships from PubMed abstracts and full-text
    articles, providing confidence-scored associations with supporting text evidence and character-level
    text locations."

  ingest_categories:
    - primary_knowledge_source
  utility: >-
    "TMKP provides literature-derived associations between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, and phenotypes.
    These associations include confidence scores, supporting text evidence, and precise character offsets
    within source documents. This supports Translator queries requiring text-mined evidence for biological
    relationships."
  scope: >-
    "This ingest processes targeted assertions from TMKP, which include high-confidence associations
    extracted from biomedical literature. The data includes nodes (genes, chemicals, diseases, phenotypes)
    and edges (various association types) with rich metadata including supporting study results, confidence
    scores, and text locations."

      description: "Compressed archive containing KGX TSV files with nodes and edges extracted from biomedical literature"

  included_content:
    - Gene/protein to chemical associations
    - Gene to disease associations
    - Gene to gene/protein associations
    - Gene to phenotype associations
    - Chemical to disease/phenotype associations
    - Supporting text evidence with character offsets
    - Confidence scores and extraction metadata
    - Publication references (PMIDs)

  filtered_content:
    - Low confidence associations (based on configurable threshold)
    - Associations without supporting text evidence

  future_considerations:
    - Integration of full-text mining results (beyond abstracts)
    - Addition of temporal information for associations
    - Inclusion of negated associations with appropriate qualifiers
