    description: >-
      IntAct is a curated, open data resource of molecular interactions hosted
      by EMBL-EBI. It stores experimentally determined molecular interactions,
      primarily protein–protein interactions, derived from literature curation
      and direct user submissions. IntAct uses detailed controlled vocabularies
      (e.g., PSI-MI) to describe experimental details such as interaction type,
      detection method, and participant roles, enabling consistent representation
      and downstream reuse of fine-grained interaction evidence.

    utility: >-
      IntAct is a key curated source of experimentally supported molecular
      interactions, particularly protein–protein interactions, which are
      critical for many NCATS Translator use cases including pathway and
      network-based reasoning, target discovery, mechanism-of-action
      hypotheses, and evaluation of biological plausibility for
      drug–disease or gene–disease connections. It provides detailed
      interaction-level metadata (e.g., detection method, interaction type,
      source database, publications) that supports evidence tracking and
      assessment of interaction quality and context.
    scope: >-
      IntAct ingest focuses on experimentally determined
      molecular interactions where at least one participant can be
      normalized to a Biolink-compatible protein or small molecule
      identifier, with an emphasis on human protein–protein interactions.
      All interaction records with valid PSI-MI interaction types and
      detection methods are considered within scope. The ingest is
      designed to preserve interaction evidence metadata (detection method,
      interaction type, source database, publications) while providing a
      Biolink-compliant edge representation.

        description: >-
          MITAB file containing binary molecular interaction records
          from IntAct for the selected release and organism/filtering
          configuration used in this ingest. The compressed file has
          both .txt and negative.txt files; only the positive interactions
          from the intact.txt file are ingested.
    included_content:
      - file_name: intact.txt
        included_records: >-
          Human–human protein positive interaction records only. A record is included if both interactors have
          organism identifiers containing "taxid:9606". These represent experimentally observed molecular interactions
          curated by IntAct/IMEx, encoded in MITAB 2.7 format
        fields_used: >-
          idA, idB (primary identifiers), altIdsA, altIdsB (alternative identifiers), 
          aliasesA, aliasesB (for extracting gene names), taxidA, taxidB (organism filtering),
          interactionTypes (for predicate mapping), publicationIDs (for evidence),
          confidenceScores (for edge properties), interactionDetectionMethod (for edge properties)
    filtered_content:
      - file_name: intact.txt
        filtered_records: >-
          All non-human interactions are excluded. A record is removed if either interactor lacks "taxid:9606".
          No additional filtering is applied.
        rationale: >-
          For Translator use cases, only human molecular interactions are required. Filtering to human–human interactions
          reduces noise from model organisms and preserves relevant biological context.
      - file_name: intact.txt                                            # MHB: I added this important filter description
        filtered_records: >-
          All records where the Interaction type(s) are not one of [`association`, `physical association`, `putative self interaction`, `self interaction`] - which account for >95% of the records. Other interaction types mainly describe specific molecular modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, acetylation), or cleavage interactions - and may  be imported in future iterations.
        rationale: >-
          Filtered records account for a very small number/proportion of the data, and would require significant effort to go into mapping/modeling/transform logic.
      - file_name: intact_negative.txt
        filtered_records: >-
          All rows are excluded.
        rationale: >-
          Negative interaction evidence does not correspond to a Biolink predicate and is not needed for molecular interaction
          reasoning. Only positive interactions are used.
    future_considerations:
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: >-
          Consider expanding beyond human-only interactions to include
          selected non-human organisms (e.g., key model organisms) where
          this adds substantial value for mechanistic or translational
          reasoning, while still maintaining manageable graph size.
        relevant_files: intact.txt
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: >-
          Consider importing the long tail of records with additional interaction types
          not taken in first iteration.
        relevant_files: intact.txt
      - category:  edge_property_content
        consideration: >-
          Longer term, consider creating ExperimentalStudyResult objects to capture metadata for each experiment that supports an edge  (e.g. interactor roles, host organism, stoichiometries, features, parameters, experiment-associated publications etc).
        relevant_files: intact.txt
    additional_notes: >-
      Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the IntAct MITAB dataset revealed 59 unique PSI-MI interaction types across
      the full resource, of which 41 appear in the human-only subset for this ingest. A similar 'long tail' distribution was observed
      for detection methods and source databases, with a small number of highly frequent, widely used terms (e.g., association, physical
      association, self interaction) and many low-frequency or highly specific terms. Based on these findings, the ingest strategy retains
      all positive human–human interactions and preserves all observed interaction types, detection methods, and source database annotations
      (without removing rare terms), while constraining biological scope to human-only records. Negative interactions were excluded for this
      version of the ingest, as they are not currently used in Translator molecular interaction reasoning or Biolink predicate mapping.

          TO DO - can adopt some of the text form the additional note below.
        additional_notes: >-
          IntAct records report the results/conclusion of a single study or experiment as curated from  a publication. There may be many records that describe the same set of interactors and interaction type - which we merge to create a single Biolink edge. It is at this level that IntAct appears to assign their confidence score, so this is applied to each such edge. Supporting publications and methods used across the set of merged experiment-level records are collapsed into a list and attached to these edges. Similarly, all sources of records that get merged into this edge are reported as "supporting data sources" in the biolink:RetrievalSource object attached to this edge.
