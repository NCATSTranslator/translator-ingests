  name: "Columbia Open Health Data (COHD)"
  description: >-
    The COHD provides access to counts and patient prevalence
    (i.e., prevalence from electronic health records) of conditions, procedures,
    drug exposures, and patient demographics, and the co-occurrence frequencies
    between them. Count and frequency data were derived from the
    Columbia University Irving Medical Center's OHDSI database including inpatient
    and outpatient data. Counts are the number of patients with the concept, e.g., 
    diagnosed with a condition, exposed to a drug, or who had a procedure. 
    Frequencies are the number of patients with the concept divided by the total number
    of patients in the dataset. Clinical concepts (e.g., conditions, procedures, drugs)
    are coded by their standard concept ID in the OMOP Common Data Model. 
    To protect patient privacy, all concepts and pairs of concepts where
    the count â‰¤ 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized by the Poisson distribution.
