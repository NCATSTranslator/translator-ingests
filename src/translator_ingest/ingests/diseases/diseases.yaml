## separate readers for textmining + knowledge files. They can be run independently of each other
readers:
  textmining:
    format: csv    ## doesn't have a tsv format option
    delimiter: "\t"
    header_mode: none    ## there isn't a header/column names row
    files:
      - "../../../../data/diseases/diseases_textmining.tsv"
    columns:
    ## naming all of them, assigning type if not str (default). Not actually using protein_name, disease_name
      - protein_id
      - protein_name
      - disease_id
      - disease_name
      - z_score: float
      - confidence_score: float
      - url
  knowledge:
    format: csv
    delimiter: "\t"
    header_mode: none
    files:
      - "../../../../data/diseases/diseases_knowledge.tsv"
    columns:
    ## naming all of them, assigning type if not str (default). Not actually using protein_name, disease_name, evidence_type
      - protein_id
      - protein_name
      - disease_id
      - disease_name
      - source_db
      - evidence_type
      ## actually an int, but making this float to match text-mining's attribute later. ?? see how it goes
      - confidence_score: float
    filters:
      ## remove rows when source_db == "UniProtKB-KW": ingest directly through that resource instead
      ## don't need to record stats on this
