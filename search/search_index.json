(HPO) provides a standard vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease.

HPO currently contains over 18,000 terms and over 156,000 annotations to hereditary diseases. The HPO project and others have developed software for phenotype-driven differential diagnostics, genomic diagnostics, and translational research. The Human Phenotype Ontology group curates and assembles over 115,000 HPO-related annotations (\"HPOA\") to hereditary diseases using the HPO ontology. Here we create Biolink associations between diseases and phenotypic features, together with their evidence, and age of onset and frequency (if known). Disease annotations here are also cross-referenced to the MONarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) (https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/).
